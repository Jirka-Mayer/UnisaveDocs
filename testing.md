# Testing

Unisave will provide a framework for automated integration testing of your backend logic. It is currently in a very raw state and so I don't want to make any promises to the public with regards to the API.

If you want to see what the result will look like, check out [integration tests in the UnisaveFixture](https://github.com/Jirka-Mayer/UnisaveAsset/tree/master/Assets/UnisaveFixture/Tests/Integration). For example this [Steam microtransactions test](https://github.com/Jirka-Mayer/UnisaveAsset/blob/master/Assets/UnisaveFixture/Tests/Integration/SteamMicrotransactions/SteamMicrotransactionTest.cs) is a good representative of what your integration tests could look like.
