# Modules overview

Modules are pieces of the Unisave framework, that are built on top of the core. It means that they are built completely using *facets* and *entities*. So not only could you write them yourself, but you can take their source code and modify it, when you need additional features.

Modules are thus meant as a scaffolding, to get you going quickly. But they are also made to be highly customizable, so you should be able to go quite far with them. They should cover most commonly needed features.

All modules are located under the namespace `Unisave.Modules`.

> **Note:** If you want to check out source code of individual modules, [browse this Github repository folder](https://github.com/Jirka-Mayer/UnisaveFramework/tree/master/UnisaveFramework/Modules).
