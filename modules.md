# Modules overview

Modules are pieces of the Unisave framework, that are built on top of the core. That means that they are built completely using *facets* and *entities*. So not only could you write them yourself, but you can take their source code and modify it, if you need additional features.

Modules are thus meant as a scaffolding, to get you going quickly. But they are also made to be highly customized, so you should be able to go quite far with them. They sould cover most commonly required features.

All modules are located under the namespace `Unsiave.Modules`.
