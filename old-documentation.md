# Old documentation

This documentation is currently deprecated, because I've recently released version `v0.5` that differs quite a bit from the old versions.

**However you can find basic info on how to setup and use Unsisave in this video:**

<div style="position: relative">
    <div style="padding-top: 56.25%"></div>
    <iframe
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XRKqy70ufYo"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

<p></p>

The video covers most of the things you need to know. I will update the documentation soon.

Thank you for your understanding.
